# Tim's Own Go Authenticator

Allows the manipulation of credentials and passwords and user priveleges. Designed to act as a middleware in
Gin Gonic authentication so we no longer have to store passwords in plain-text. 

Users and their hashed passwords and privileges can be stored or retrieved in JSON format.
